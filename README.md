# CS 564 Fall 2017 C++ Session

This repository contains code that I wrote for the CS 368 C++ session, as well
as fixes that I made afterward. To clone this repo, run:

    $ git clone git@github.com:varuncnaik/cppsession-fa17.git

## Resources

* [cppreference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/w/) is a great resource for C++
  documentation.
* If you have questions about C++, someone has probably asked it already on
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and received an answer. If you
  can't find the answer to your question, then of course, Piazza and office
  hours are also options.
* The [GCC online documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/) has links to
  the manuals for many of the versions of g++. Each manual describes ways to
  configure g++, and it is much more readable than the output of `man g++`.
